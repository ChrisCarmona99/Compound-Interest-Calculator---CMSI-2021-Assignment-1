# Compound-Interest-Calculator---CMSI-2021-Assignment-1

This Repository contains all of the files for our Compound Interest Calculator. Claudia Gusti and myself worked on this homework together. The calculator is a web app that allows users to enter a Principle, Interest Rate, Times Compounded, and Years, in which the app will then calculate the compound interest.
